# Pitch-Perfect
Pitch Perfect is an iOS application that records the voice of the user using the device's microphone and then allows users to play the recorded voice in various effects: Snail (slow), Rabbit (fast), Chipmunk (high pitch), Darth Vader (low pitch), Echo and Reverb.

For this project, we learned basic functionality of Xcode such as:
- action and outlets
- appropriately position UI elements on the screen for iPhone and iPad portrait and landscape layouts
- use the delegate pattern and implement the audioRecorderDidFinishRecording() method
- create a segue from the first scene to the second programmatically
- navigate back to the first scene from the second by embedding a UINavigationController

We learned how to implement AVFoundation properties such as: 
- audioRecorder 
- audioFile
- audioEngine
- audioPlayerNode
